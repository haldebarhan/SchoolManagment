# Overview

As a software engineer, continuous learning is crucial for staying ahead in an ever-evolving field. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of the Java programming language, focusing on key concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and file handling. This software showcases a school management system that allows you to add and manage different types of people (teachers and students), while utilizing inheritance, polymorphism, and collection frameworks.

In writing this software, my goal was to deepen my understanding of Java's syntax, data manipulation, and its object-oriented nature. The project also integrates file reading and writing, further emphasizing how to handle input and output operations in Java.
